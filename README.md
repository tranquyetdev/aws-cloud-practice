# Practice

This repository consist of my hands on examples to learn and practice provisioning AWS infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline to deploy different apps.

- [Nx](https://nx.dev/): The build system for Monorepo
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): Infrastructure as code
- [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions): CI/CD workflow
- Finally, `terraform destroy` to clean up :)
